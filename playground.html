           Think of yourself, for a moment, as a shape. This shape is unique to you, with edges and curves and alcoves that only you have. It is all yours, this shape, one defined by your thoughts and obsessions and bad habits and favorite foods and tiny observations and all the parking tickets you’ve ever gotten. Maybe this shape, this outline, if you will, has zigzags or loops that go on for miles. Maybe it has concentric layers that all connect, like a curly cue, but in the form of you. Maybe it is straightforward like the chalk on the ground of a murder scene or is one big outline made up of a bunch of smaller outlines. Maybe it’s marked in words instead of a single line, like a concrete poem, or maybe it’s really a container for a bunch of words to live together in disorder, no pattern evident. 
<br><br>
Now: There are 3 kinds of people you come across in life. 
<br><br>
The first is someone who disrupts your outlines. They step under them like caution tape at the scene of a crime or touch them like fine art with a DO NOT TOUCH THE ART placard right next to it. This person does not see the value of your shape, the purpose of your alcoves, nor the opportunity at each of your edges. They turn your perfectly taut outline into a misshapen form, giving you more background noise to manage and more mental clutter to sift through. 
<br><br>
The second person expands your outlines. They might help you think differently or see things in a new way. They stretch you a little bigger, honoring your shape with gentle receptiveness to who you are, making sure you keep your form as you step into greater expression. They may even present you with a different purpose for one of your corners or an alternate path from your horizons.
<br><br>
The third person, the rarity, is someone who helps you trace over your own outlines. They help you become the most defined version of you in a way that only they can do at this moment in time and space. They see the outlines of you even when you can’t, finding faint or stagnant parts of you radiating from within that perhaps you forgot were there, pulling them to the surface and helping you lock them into place, filling in blanks you originally thought were intentional dotted lines. 
<br><br>
Each person serves us with their disruption, with their expansion, or with their definition; each life we cross paths with is a change in shape, for better or for worse. We must seek only to be alert to the change and learn to protect our outlines with ferocity, kindness, and love for the sake of ourselves.
