        Hello
        <br><br>
        I am writing to you from the past. December 2nd, 2021 to be exact, when it struck me that I've been poorly stewarding my own interests. An idea came to me that I think has been quietly steeping in me for a while, but one that did not reveal itself until now.
        <br><br>
        I am embarking on something of an early-aughts book blog. As you may or may not know, I like to post book reviews to my instagram story every time I finish a book. Those will continue if you are a satisfied part of that audience and prefer to get your content in bite-sized pieces. But in an effort and desire to expand my ability to analyze content in a more long-form, nuanced format, I wanted to create a space for my reviews that can’t be summarized in a single paragraph packaged for people who are quickly tapping through brunch photos and infographics.
        <br><br>
        I’ve had a handful of people tell me they really enjoy my book reviews, which is really nice! Thank you to those people! This will be a place to dig a little deeper and develop a voice that isn’t my instagram voice, which can be a real loose cannon and sometimes, I regret to admit, seeps into my real-person voice.
        <br><br>
        I’d love for this to be a two-way street. If you misunderstand some really esoteric metaphor I attempt to make, let a girl know. I don’t want to assume that there will be high traffic on this street, but it’d be nice to know I’m not shouting into the void, if only sometimes. Other times, I’ll let the void absorb me, which is fine and probably healthy for my online ego.
        <br><br>
        This is also an attempt to dust off and practice my basic coding skills, so I might redecorate between your visits since I own this house (domain) and pay the mortgage (subscription) for it. Hope that’s ok (It is. This is my website).
        <br><br>
        See you soon.
        <br><br>
        Your wannabe substack girly,
        <br><br>
