       You know when you’re watching a movie and things start to get crackly and echoey to indicate that you're experiencing an alternate reality? (Have you seen Don’t Worry Darling?) That’s what this book is. 'Bunny' by Mona Awad is surrealist literature. It is the modern-day Frankenstein. The hook is loneliness and the object is desire. 
<br><br>
Samantha is a young woman in her final year of grad school, a writer (which is a trope I am somehow never able to escape in today’s popular literature — I guess you have to write about what you know — but one that was surprisingly not an eyeroll this time) working on her thesis and suffering through the presence of the four girls in her cohort: Eleanor, Caroline, Kira, and Victoria. These girls refer to one another as ‘bunny’ and giggle constantly through their speech like sorority sisters, their every adjective punctuated by the lackluster ‘so’: so creepy, so scary, soooo cute. Samantha refers to them internally as The Duchess, Cupcake, Creepy Doll, and Vignette, respectively. She despises their family money and saccharine communication style and childlike attitudes.
<br><br>
Samantha’s imagination keeps her high off the ground of real life and at a distance from the bunnies. It’s the tree she climbs to retreat from her loneliness, where she can create an inner reality for herself and build universes of lives that keep her safe. Her only friends are Ava, a subversive gypsy who dresses like Madonna in the 80s and lives in town, and Jonah, a fellow master’s student who in my mind is trait-for-trait just Jacob from Abbott Elementary. 
<br><br>
The bunnies invite Samantha over one night. She is hesitant to go. Her hatred for these girls runs deep, but she’s so lonely. When she attends, the bunnies’ sorority-like behavior turns cultish. Samantha’s mental acuity is challenged with ever-flowing alcohol and mysterious tic-tac-looking pills throughout the night as the bunnies draw out story after story from her. She is overserved and oversharing. 
<br><br>
The magnitude of 'Bunny' relies on Samantha’s unacknowledged loneliness. She’s in love with her own outsiderness. The bunnies’ one melted, collective identity that feels threatening in the classroom is desperately desired once she receives an invitation to be part of it. In Samantha’s visit to The Duchess’ house, we find out that the bunnies have a dark, twisted ritual: they summon humanity into existence in the name of expression. These expressions, these Drafts and Darlings as the bunnies refer to them, are men. Men with slightly deformed facial features and missing appendages. They are gleaned from the bunnies’ memories and experiences with men, physical details extrapolated from former lovers. Explicitly, the Darlings are manifested using bunnies, which transform into men upon summoning and are killed with an ax once they reveal their subhuman nature. 
<br><br>
Yes, how weird. But Samantha is being brainwashed. Her inner monologue softens into the bunny hive mind; she begins to punctuate her sentences with frilly adjectives, refer to herself as “we”, and consume pink sugary pastries exclusively. Her nicknames for the girls now vanish as the informal ‘bunny’ is used indulgently to refer to them. 
<br><br>
Ava ultimately saves Samantha, pulling her from the pack one afternoon when the bunnies are on their way to the mall. She has suffered Stockholm syndrome, these 4 girls exposing her to violent episodes of prototype men being killed by an ax every single night. Ava rehabilitates her, but not before the bunnies invite her back to prove herself one last time: show us you can do The Work, that you are mentally skilled enough to manifest a man. 
<br><br>
And so, Samantha manifests her own boy, Max, who is an amalgamation of ex boyfriends and former acquaintances. Max infiltrates her life, her mind, and her thesis work. He becomes Frankenstein, much bigger of a problem than she ever expected him to be. He can read her mind. He is an expression of her love for Ava, so much so that they become lovers. He hacks Samantha’s entire life — making moves to vindicate all her innermost thoughts and desires while creating a wake of destruction in her own path. 
<br><br>
As Samantha reenters what we believe is her original reality, thanks to Ava’s rescue mission, we see rare and new glimpses of an inner monologue that is entirely her own. It feels fully owned and authentic, and it doesn’t have the glare of an imagined outsider’s perception like the previous events did. As these glimpses become more evident, they also become more warped. There is evidence that imagined universes upon imagined universes are at play here. 
<br><br>
In the end, we find out that Ava never really existed. She was an imaginary friend all along. A manifestation of Samantha’s hatred of her world. Their conversations were a version of Samantha in concert with a different version of herself. Ava was a way to cope with loneliness — a way to disassociate from the world, a strategy to fill the silence that surrounded her. 
<br><br>
This final twist feels vaguely familiar and too accessible, like ending an elementary school essay with “and it was all a dream.” It’s especially bewildering given that the summoning of men from bunnies was the real part instead of the friendship. To keep the most inane details of the story exclusive from this unreality is jarring. Why save the ugly and dispose of the most lovely, human pieces? Ava’s friendship with Samantha was a respite from the cliques and deadlines and pressures of a lonely season, but in the end that respite never existed at all. Perhaps that’s the hardest part of life to accept: we don’t get to choose our reality. But if we can't accept it, at least we have our imaginations to keep us company.
