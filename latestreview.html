       <div class="review">
       I have a rule that I write my book reflections before reading any other reviews. I’m too impressionable to hear what other people think before forming my own opinion. Though that has not been the case with this one because I didn’t like it and, frankly, didn’t get it? I needed other people to help me make sense of it, so I took to the internet to uncover what made this book so special to be chosen as a finalist for the national book awards. 
<br><br>
Her Body and Other Parties by Carmen Maria Machado is a collection of short stories. The common theme among all of them is female pain, both physical and psychological. At the risk of an unoriginal comparison, it was similar in style to my recent read Pure Colour and had DNA similar to Gingerbread – two books that warp the meaning of present thought. 
<br><br>
In Ted Chiang style (who is ironically one of Machado’s favorite authors), the longest story in this book was my least favorite, naturally: an episode-by-episode rundown of every plot point in Law and Order SVU’s episode catalog. I had some hang ups with this. First of all, I don’t watch Law and Order because I have to be careful what I put into my brain. And so after reading this specific chapter, I’m like, did I just not know what Law and Order was about? Are these descriptions real? Is Olivia Benson actually hearing the voices of dead girls with bells for eyes in her head? Or does what I’m describing fall into the category of fan fiction? Also, in a book that’s already segmented into separate stories by nature of the structure, the last thing I want to read is a glorified list that forces my brain to constantly jump through the knowledge of a franchise I know nothing about. 
<br><br>
That was my problem with this book: I didn’t know which aspects of it were supposed to be taken as hyperbolic and which ones weren’t. Even if I was a Law and Order fan, this struggle carried across all chapters. And when you don’t have the long arc of a novel to smooth things out for you, I barely had time to surface my questions before I was ushered into the next story. 
<br><br>
I do think the ordering of the stories at least helped me understand Machado’s intent, which seems to be to expand how we represent female pain and the psychological warfare that takes place inside women’s heads. The first story, The Husband Stitch, was the old tale of the girl with the green ribbon around her neck. Because I had heard the story before, as have (probably) most readers, it set the tone for me to understand what I was stepping into. 
<br><br>
In The Resident chapter, when an unnamed narrator gets accepted to an artist’s residency in the mountains, there was deliberate foreshadowing the entire time, but nothing ever came of the mysterious details given to the characters of this chapter? I was waiting for a gotcha moment that never came. The chapter was filled with recollections of the narrator, C— M—, being bullied as a Brownie when she was a little girl, and then on a walk in the woods, she finds a little girl who has been misplaced from the rest of her Brownie troupe. The Painter character was always aloof, her actual name constantly escaping from C— M—’s grasp, but ultimately for no reason. There were thunderstorms. C— M— never received any responses to the letters she would mail her wife. There was a scene when she became mysteriously sick after a turbulent night of dinner and wine with the other guests; she slept for days and awoke violently ill. What am I supposed to make of all of this if the knot of foreshadowing isn’t tightened into place by the end? What is the whole point?  
<br><br>
In an attempt to expand our thinking around the pain and mental gymnastics that women have to endure to exist in this world, it would seem that Machado was successful, in that I myself endured misunderstanding and confusion while reading Her Body and Other Parties, and, in a twisted way, what a beautiful and devious way to reach your reader.
