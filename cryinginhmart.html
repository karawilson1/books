         <div class="trigger"> Disclaimer: This book review discusses grief, loss, and losing a parent. In the past, it has been disarming for me to read media that discusses topics since losing my mom without a warning, and I considered not writing this because it felt too personal. This book is about losing a parent, which is not an experience I want to minimize or exploit, but the project of grief refraction offered by this book seemed more helpful than harmful to me in my personal processing. Writing this all out was heavy, but it did serve me in the end. My words were chosen tactfully because I wanted them to be precise in order to fulfill its service to me and not linger too long so as to cross into the realm of oversharing. Read with care.

Since losing my own mom, I have largely kept my distance from grief books, with the exception of one novel that was just imperceptible enough from my journey through loss to classify it as Too Close to Home. I don’t want to read Joan Didion’s A Year of Magical Thinking and I’d rather not claw my way through C.S. Lewis’ A Grief Observed, no matter how many times people with both parents still alive suggest them to me. But the thing that drew me to Crying in H Mart was its resemblance to my own experience. It was written in the direct wake of loss, seemingly in the spirit of running from the fear of never processing it, a fear I face often. <br><br>
I do not want to linger here long. But I really loved this book so much. <br><br>
It was made up of tiny, acute sadnesses that were woven into a tapestry of diagnostic, capital-S Sadness. It wasn't afraid of facing the heartbreak of losing a parent or the devastating thoughts that surface when you do, and it made me feel seen in mine. It described the way we tuck ourselves into other things in our loss, and how something as biologically necessary as food can you hold you up and take the first step for you as you wake up each day to grieve all over again. It had sentences like, “It didn’t feel like a day on which someone had died,” that were reductive to the point of making me question how grief can be universal and unique at the same time. <br><br>
	This book feels like an act of communion, of fellowship in remembering. There’s a tenderness in the way Zauner recollects the final few months she had with her mother, delicate in honor yet sober in truth, eerily familiar to anyone who’s gone through something of the same caliber. Watching someone lose autonomy over their body is haunting. It’s something I’ve tried to attach internal words to many times over the past few years but fallen short of, not because it’s impossible, but because it’s unbearable. But Michelle Zauner took up the opportunity with care and patience. <br><br>
	I know well the desire to talk about my own mom, to keep her around. It feels like people should be asking me constantly how I’m doing with it all. Remind me about my mom, that she was here, that she was alive. Let me write a book about her so I have an excuse to keep grieving, to keep processing. And if I can’t have that, let me instead have a book that gives its author that chance. Because that book is proof that life returns. That death produces something in those who are still living. That the law of conservation of energy is upheld by both the living and the dead, meaning balanced perfectly between them.
