         <div class="trigger">TW: grief, cancer, losing a parent — I considered not writing this because it felt too personal. This book is about losing a parent, which is not an experience I want to minimize or exploit, but the project of grief refraction offered by this book seemed more helpful than harmful to me in my personal processing. Writing this all out was heavy, but it did serve me in the end. I spent time tactfully choosing each word, moreso than usual, because I wanted it to be precise in order to fulfill its service to me.

Since losing my own mom, I have largely kept my distance from grief books, with the exception of one novel that was just imperceptible enough from my journey through loss to classify it as Too Close to Home. I don’t want to read Joan Didion’s A Year of Magical Thinking and I’d rather not claw my way through C.S. Lewis’ A Grief Observed, no matter how many times people with both parents still alive suggest them to me. But the thing that drew me to Crying in H Mart <em>was<em> its resemblance to my experience. It was written in the direct wake of loss, seemingly in the spirit of running from the fear of never processing it. <br><br>
I will not linger too long on this book. I will not be analyzing it or summarizing it or pontificating in its name. I will try to be succinct and be on my merry way.  <br><br>
But I really loved it so much. <br><br>
The tiny, acute sadnesses soaked into a tapestry of diagnostic, capital-S Sadness. The heartbreaking thoughts transcribed. The descriptions of how food held her up and took the first step for her, while caring and grieving and breaking. The sentence, “It didn’t feel like a day on which someone had died.”  <br><br>
	This book feels like an act of communion, of fellowship in remembering. There’s a tenderness in the way Zauner recollects the final few months she had with her mother, delicate in honor yet sober in truth, eerily familiar to anyone who’s gone through something of the same caliber. Watching someone lose autonomy over their body is haunting. It’s something I’ve tried to attach words to many times over the past few years but fallen short of, not because it’s impossible, but because it’s unbearable. But Michelle Zauner took up the opportunity with wisdom and humility. <br><br>
	I know well the desire to talk about my mom, to keep her around. It feels like people should be asking me constantly how I’m doing with it all. Remind me about my mom, that she was here, that she was alive. Let me write a book about her so I have an excuse to keep grieving, to keep processing. And if I can’t have that, let me have a book that gives its author that chance. Because that book is proof that life returns. That death produces something in those who are still living. That the law of conservation of energy is upheld by both the living and the dead, meaning balanced perfectly between them.
